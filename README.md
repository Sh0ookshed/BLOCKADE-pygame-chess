# chess
rust chess software 

# what is this software?
This is a chess program that contains both back and front end allowing the user to play against a chess bot. I'm trying to make this in a unique way that allows for a python GUI using pygame and then a rust backend. These two will then be linked together using PY03 to turn the rust backend into python modules to allow for chess to be played in a pygame program that runs off of rust logic to improve speed and accuracy. It will have a variety of features and is designed to be used casually and will not link to any databases or external websites as it is an offline experience. 

# features:
COMING SOON

# If you think the project is cool 🔥🔥🔥
I will include all of my documentation and planning for this project inside of the repository for anyone to access to see my thought process and how i designed certain parts of the code.
